copyPasta
=========

Not built for portability.


copyPasta was built specifically for my laptop configuration.
I'm gone for the next two years and will be sending home my cameras SD card, this makes it easy for my parents
to automatically backup the pictures to my HDD, and Dropbox, then erase the SD Card all at once.
The code may not be beautiful, but it'll sufice.

You are free to do what you please with this code, except make money from it.
